     <h1>Welcome to Adrian's Javascripts page </h1>
<p id= "Jparagaph"> Here I have done several pieces with Khan academy where I have constructed html together to create the following, 
    Links, images, tables, and standard html. Which in addition is reflected on this webpage.
     By simply adding the anchor tag to html one can make a link. 
     Furthermore to create an image one would have to use that tag and inside the quotes one can paste the desired image. 
    Tables uses more tags however by using the basic thead and tbody it can get one very far. </p>
